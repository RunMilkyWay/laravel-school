About Laravel

Laravel is a popular PHP web application framework designed for building modern web applications with an elegant, simple syntax. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which helps organize and structure code in a maintainable way. Laravel comes with a wide array of built-in features and tools, including routing, authentication, ORM (Eloquent), database migrations, and task scheduling, making it easy for developers to build robust and scalable web applications quickly.

Some of the key features of Laravel include:

	•	Eloquent ORM: An expressive and fluent way to interact with your database, using Active Record principles.
	•	Routing: Clean and simple routing to manage web requests.
	•	Blade Templating Engine: A lightweight, powerful templating engine that helps in separating application logic from presentation.
	•	Authentication & Authorization: Built-in support for user authentication, authorization, and password handling.
	•	Artisan CLI: A command-line tool for automating repetitive tasks and generating code.
	•	Task Scheduling: Define and schedule commands to be executed automatically at set intervals.
	•	Middleware: Easily filter HTTP requests entering your application, allowing greater control over request handling.

Laravel aims to make the development process enjoyable and straightforward while maintaining flexibility and scalability, suitable for small projects as well as large-scale enterprise applications.
